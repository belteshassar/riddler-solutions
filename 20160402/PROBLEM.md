# Can You Solve The Impossible Puzzle?

Now, here’s this week’s Riddler, a twist on the so-called “impossible
puzzle” (happy April Fool’s Day!) which comes to us from Max Wahlund
of Linköping, Sweden.



Three very skilled logicians are sitting around a table — Barack, Pete and
Susan. Barack says: “I’m thinking of two natural numbers between 1 and 9,
inclusive. I’ve written the product of these two numbers on this paper that
I’m giving to you, Pete. I’ve written the sum of the two numbers on this
paper that I’m giving to you, Susan. Now Pete, looking at your paper, do
you know which numbers I’m thinking of?”

Pete looks at his paper and says: “No, I don’t.”

Barack turns to Susan and asks: “Susan, do you know which numbers I’m
thinking of?” Susan looks at her paper and says: “No.”

Barack turns back to Pete and asks: “How about now? Do you know?”

“No, I still don’t,” Pete says.

Barack keeps going back and forth, and when he asks Pete for the fifth time,
Pete says: “Yes, now I know!”

First, what are the two numbers? Second, *if* Pete had said no the fifth time,
would Susan have said yes or no at her fifth turn?
